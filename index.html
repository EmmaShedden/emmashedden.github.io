<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I am a computer science undergraduate researcher and student advised by <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw/">Westley Weimer</a> at the Unviersity of Michigan. I was a 2022 Software Engineer Intern at Facebook (Now Meta). Prior to that, I was a Software Research Intern at <a href="https://s3d.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon Unviersity's Software and Societal Systems Department </a> through the National Science Foundation sponsored <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/scs/s3d/reuse/">REUSE program</a>. While completing research at Carnegie Mellon Unviersity, I was advised by <a href="https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/directory/bios/kang-eunsuk.html">Eunsuk Kang</a> and a member of <a href="https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/index.html">CyLab</a></p>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>

<p><b><i>Currently, I am applying to Computer Science PhD programs starting in Fall 2024</i></b></p>


<p>I plan to conduct research on topics that creatively leverage the mathematical foundations of computer science to improve real-world software such as Formal Methods, Formal Verification, and Algorithms and Complexity Theory.</p>
